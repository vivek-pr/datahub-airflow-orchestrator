# Contributing
- Use issues in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` to plan & track work.
- Keep docs source-of-truth; do not leak secrets into examples.
- Prefer tests-first for integration points (Airflow API; Action contracts).

## Working with AI
- Reference the acceptance criteria in each issue.
- Generate code in feature branches; open PRs with test evidence.
